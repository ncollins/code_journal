===================

Our project,
[github.com/ncollins/codeacrossnyc](https://github.com/ncollins/codeacrossnyc),
won the prize for community board engagement which was nice :)
No major coding revelations, but I realized I should use the `dateutil` model
more when converting dates. Simply `pip install python-dateutil` and

```python
import dateutil.parser
d = dateutil.parser.parse('2014-02-23T00:00:00')
```
