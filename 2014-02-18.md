====================

Worked through the [Microsoft F# tutorials](http://www.tryfsharp.org/Learn).
Started working on Project Euler #96 in F#. I like F# and it may
become my prefered ML, but I'm not up to speed on idomatic usage. I
had problems that I suspect relate to the
[value restriction](http://mlton.org/ValueRestriction) rule; I struggled to 
use `<<` and `>>`, and setled for `|>` which includes the final argument of
the composed function. For example:

```fsharp
let colValues grid (x,y) =
    grid |> filterByKey (fun (x1, y1) -> y = y1) |> values
```
