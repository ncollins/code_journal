======================

Mild case of impostor syndrome at work, after interviewing a candidate who was
rejected and wondering if I was really that much better than them. My attempt
at the problem before the interview did actually work though (I initially thought
it had a bug).

I need to learn the VBA and OCaml standard libraries more thoroughly. I realised
I don't know the functions for string handling well in VBA, and I shouldn't let
the problems with the language become an excuse for programming poorly.

Working on [Stockfighter](https://www.stockfighter.io), and struggling with
Asyncio in Python. I'm going to try and document some of my confusion and
progress here.

I'm currently calling `loop.create_task(f)` where `f` is an `async` function.
I can't see the results of the `print` inside the function but it doesn't
seem to be erroring either.

I do not understand the difference between coroutines, Futures, and Tasks.
