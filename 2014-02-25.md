====================

I decided to redirect my F# efforts from Sudoku to the
[8 queens problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle)
after a lot of buzz about it inside Hacker School. (Check out
[this one](http://davidad.github.io/blog/2014/02/25/overkilling-the-8-queens-problem/)!)

My solution is
[here](https://github.com/ncollins/hs_interview_questions/blob/master/search_and_constraint/EightQueens.fs).
I haven't had time to look into it's speed performance yet. I'm hoping to get more insights when returning to
Sudoku or other constrain and search problems. The one area I spent a while debuging was the `target` function,
initially I used the wrong variable by mistake (types don't save you from everything, though I guess I could
have `Row`, `Column`, `RowDelta` and `ColumnDelta` as distinct types!), I then had a problem with my logic
and went from marking too few squares as `Unsafe` to too many (all of them in fact!)
