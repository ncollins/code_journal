=====================

I attended the CodeAcrossNYC with [BetaNYC](http://betanyc.us/). I wrote some
code that will sent an email via SMTP using Jinja2 for HTML templating. I
discovered that you can link to an attachement inside your HTML using `Content-ID`
headers. In Python:

```python
with open('test.png') as f:
    img = MIMEImage(f.read())
    img.add_header('Content-ID', '<image1>')
    msg.attach(img)
```
