====================

I continued working on my Sudoku solver in F#. I had a few thoughts:

- After skimming over (Peter Norvig's Sudoku solver)[http://norvig.com/sudoku.html] I
realized I needed to think harder about the bounderies betweeen constrain propagation and search.
- It's probably a good idea to write some generalized search routines in F#.
- I'm not sure how to do memoization in a functional manner.
- I'd like to know how to do lazy calculations or short-circuit certain operations.

Current progress is in a (gist)[https://gist.github.com/ncollins/44b6a6de21f8d5074aa3].
